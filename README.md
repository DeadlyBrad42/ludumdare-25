#ludumdare-25
### Prison Break
A game where you must help a recently-escaped convict dash across town to enjoy a drink at the local pub. Dodge cops! Beat up civilians for money! Good, clean, fun for the whole family!

## i can haz download
Sure! The download is [available here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/222742/PrisonBreak.zip), and there's more information about it on [on my blog](http://codemoosey.com/post/38209960309/finished-my-entry-for-ludum-dare-the-game-is).

Here's a [link to my official entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/12/17/finished-125/).

## Why is the premise so... awful?
This year's Ludum Dare theme was "You are the villain". 

## This art looks stolen!
Art is not my strongest suit, and to be honest I was more interested in building a game than drawing sprites for one.
* Characters are ripped from River City Ransom, with some light re-coloring by me.
* Terrain and background art is from [Liberated Pixel Cup Base Assets](http://opengameart.org/content/liberated-pixel-cup-base-assets-sprites-map-tiles) set, from [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org).
* I found the prison image [on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41894165897@N01/2321458507)

## Man, this code seriously sucks.
Yeah, it does :( I was running out of time while making it, but I had no shortage of ideas. I wouldn't recommend anyone uses this code for anything beyond basic curiousity.

## Who do I blame for this mess?
